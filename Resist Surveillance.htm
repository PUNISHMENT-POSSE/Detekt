            <p>In recent years we have witnessed a huge growth in the adoption and trade in communication surveillance technologies. Such spyware provides the ability to read personal emails, listen-in skype conversations or even remotely turn on a computers camera and microphone without its owner knowing about it.</p>
            <p>Some of this software is widely available on the Internet, while some more sophisticated alternatives are made and sold by private companies based in industrialized countries to state law enforcement and intelligence agencies in countries across the world.</p>
            <p>There is little to no regulation currently in place to safeguard against these technologies being sold or used by repressive governments or others who are likely to use them for serious human rights violations and abuses.</p>
            <p>You can find many reports on the use of spyware against civil society <a href="/reports.html">here</a>. You can learn more about the trade in unlawful surveillance equipment by visiting the <a href="http://www.globalcause.net/" target="_blank">Coalition Against Unlawful Surveillance Exports</a> website.</p>

            <h2>It has been well documented that governments are using surveillance technology to target human rights defenders, journalists, NGOs, political opponents, religious or ethnic minorities and to conduct countrywide surveillance.</h2>

            <p>It is important to underline that if Detekt does not find trace of spyware on a computer, it does not necessarily mean that none is present. Some spyware will likely be updated in response to the release of Detekt in order to avoid detection. In addition, there may be existing versions of spyware, from these or other providers, which are not detected by this tool.</p>

            <p>Detekt is currently available in Amharic, Arabic, English, German, Italian and Spanish. You can choose your preferred languagea from a dropdown menu.</p>
            <p>Once launched, the tool will open a graphical interface and when instructed to Scan, it will start analyzing the computer's memory in order to look for traces of the spyware.</p>
            <p class="typeNoMarg">This scanning process might take even up to 30 minutes, depending on the performances of the computer.</p>

            <p>When the execution is completed, the tool will present the outcome of the scan and will clearly indicate whether an infection was found.</p>
            <p class="typeNoMarg">The tool also generates a log file with additional details that can be useful for technical experts to further investigate. We recommend you print or save a copy of the log file (somewhere other than your infected computer) and provide this to a technical expert when seeking assistance.</p>

            <p>In case the tool identifies the presence of some spyware on your computer, you should <a href="emergency.html">follow the instructions available here</a> and seek assistance. In some cases Detekt can be wrong so it is important to have an expert review your computer.</p>
            <p class="typeNoMarg">Detekt does not remove any infection or delete any file that it considers suspicious. If Detekt indicates signs of infection, you should assume that your computer has been compromised and is no longer safe for use. The attacker will likely have remote-control access of your computer, meaning they can view not only your files and emails but everything you type on your keyboard and could even switch on your webcam and microphone remotely.</p>
